for details.) These regime shifts are preannounced by the government, so no predictions of the shifts are necessary, though few people can predict the exact consequences of the regulatory changes. Some of the other most common financial or economic regimes studied are inflationary vs. recessionary regimes, high- vs. lowvolatility regimes, and mean-reverting vs. trending regimes.

will continue. As news disseminates at a faster rate and as more traders take advantage of this trend earlier on, the equilibrium price will be reached sooner. Any trade entered after this equilibrium price is reached will be unprofitable. REGIME SWITCHING* The concept of regimes is most basic to financial markets. What else are bull and bear markets if not regimes?

f not regimes? The desire to predict regime switches, which are also commonly known as turning points, is also as old as financial markets themselves. If our attempts to predict the switching from a bull to a bear market were even slightly successful, we could focus our *This section was adapted from an article I published in Automated Trader magazine. discussion to this one type of switching and call it a day. If only it were that easy.

at that time. Therefore, when judging the suitability of a strategy, one must pay particular attention to its performance in the most recent few years, and not be fooled by the overall performance, which inevitably includes some rosy numbers back in the old days. Finally, regime shifts in the financial markets can mean that financial data from an earlier period simply cannot be fitted to the same model that is applicable today.

ere that easy. The difficulty with predicting this type of switching encourages researchers to look more broadly at other types of regime switching in the financial markets, hoping to find some that may be more amenable to existing statistical tools.

new strategy. If the backtest performance is still reasonable, your poor live trading performance may just be due to bad luck. Regime shifts refer to the situation when the financial market structure or the macroeconomic environment undergoes a drastic change so much so that trading strategies that were profitable before may not be profitable now. There are two noteworthy regime shifts in recent years related to market (or regulatory) structure that may affect certain strategies.

licable today. Major regime shifts can occur because of changes in securities market regulation (such as decimalization of stock prices or the elimination of the short-sale rule, which I allude to in Chapter 5) or other macroeconomic events (such as the subprime mortgage meltdown). This point may be hard to swallow for many statistically minded readers. Many of them may think that the more data there is, the more statistically robust the backtest should be.

nding regimes. There are some tricky data issues involved with backtesting mean-reversion strategies: Outlier quotes and survivorship bias are among them. Trending regimes are usually triggered by the diffusion of new information, the execution of a large institutional order, or herding behavior. Competition between traders tends to reduce the number of mean-reverting trading opportunities. Competition between traders tends to reduce the optimal holding period of a momentum trade.

um strategies. Periods of meanreverting and trending behaviors are examples of what some traders call regimes, and the switch between different regimes is a topic of discussion here. Mean-reverting strategies derive their mathematical justification from the concepts of stationarity and cointegration of time series, which I will cover next.

regime switch. Variables such as current volatility; last-period return; or changes in macroeconomic numbers such as consumer confidence, oil price changes, bond price changes, and so on can all be part of this input. In fact, in a very topical article about turning points in the real estate market by economist Robert Schiller (2007), it was suggested that the crescendo of media chatter about impending boom or bust may actually be a good predictor of a coming turning point.
