their returns. Factor models, or arbitrage pricing theory, are commonly used for modeling how fundamental factors affect stock returns linearly. One of the most well-known factor models is the Fama-French Three-Factor model, which postulates that stock returns are proportional to their beta and book-to-price ratio, and negatively to their market capitalizations. Factor models typically have a relatively long holding period and long drawdowns due to regime switches.

Naturally, it mostly depends on which factor model we are looking at. But one can make a general observation that factor models that are dominated by fundamental and macroeconomic factors have one major drawbackthey depend on the fact that investors persist in using the same metric to value companies.

rs of returns? There is a well-known framework in quantitative finance called factor models (also known as arbitrage pricing theory [APT]) that attempts to capture the different drivers of returns such as earnings growth rates, interest rate, or the market capitalization of a company. These drivers are called factors.
