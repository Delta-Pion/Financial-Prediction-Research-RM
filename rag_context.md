### Context Chunk 1
Kelly formula. Besides the determination of the optimal leverage, the Kelly formula has a very useful side benefit: It also determines the optimal allocation of capital among different strategies, based on the covariance of their returns. But no risk management formula or system will prevent disasters if you are not psychologically prepared for the ups and downs of trading and thus deviating from the prescriptions of rational decision making (i.e., your models).

### Context Chunk 2
la recommends. RISK MANAGEMENT We saw in the previous section that the Kelly formula is not only useful for the optimal allocation of capital and for the determination of the optimal leverage, but also for risk management. In fact, the SPY example (6.2) illustrated that the Kelly formula would advise you to reduce the portfolio size in the face of trading losses.

### Context Chunk 3
f your wealth. APPENDIX: A SIMPLE DERIVATION OF THE KELLY FORMULA WHEN RETURN DISTRIBUTION IS GAUSSIAN If we assume that the return distribution of a strategy (or security) is Gaussian, then the Kelly formula can be derived very easily. We start with the formula for a compounded, levered growth rate applicable to a Gaussian process: g( f) = r + fm?

### Context Chunk 4
ital each day. How should the Kelly formula be used to determine the capital in this case when we donÂ’t know what it will be beforehand? One can still use the Kelly formula to determine the maximum number of positions and thus the maximum capital allowed. It is always safer to have a leverage below what the Kelly formula recommends.

### Context Chunk 5
( f) = r + fm? s2 f2/2 where f is the leverage, r is the risk-free rate; m is the average simple, uncompounded one-period excess return; and s is the standard deviation of those uncompounded returns. This formula for compounded growth rate can itself be derived quite simply, but not as simply as the Kelly formula, so I leave its derivation for the reader to look up in the Thorp article referenced earlier.
