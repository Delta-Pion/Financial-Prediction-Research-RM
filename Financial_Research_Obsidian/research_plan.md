# Financial Prediction Research Project Plan

This document outlines the steps for a research project focused on financial prediction using machine learning and AI, based on transactional data from an expense tracker and stock market data.

## Phase 1: Expense Tracker Data Analysis and Prediction

1.  **Data Collection and Preparation:**
    *   **Format:** Understand the format of your expense tracker data (e.g., CSV, JSON, database).
    *   **Features:** Identify the relevant features in your data (e.g., date, amount, category, merchant, description).
    *   **Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    *   **Transformation:** Convert categorical features into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding). Create time-based features (e.g., day of week, month, year).

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   **Visualization:** Use charts and graphs to understand spending patterns (e.g., spending by category, trends over time).
    *   **Summary Statistics:** Calculate descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) to identify key spending habits.

3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Lagged Features:** Create features based on past spending (e.g., average spending in the last week, month).
    *   **Rolling Statistics:** Calculate rolling means and standard deviations to capture trends and volatility.

4.  **Model Selection and Training:**
    *   **Regression Models:** For predicting transaction amounts, consider regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, or Gradient Boosting Regression.
    *   **Classification Models:** For predicting transaction categories, consider classification models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or Random Forest.
    *   **Time Series Models:** For predicting spending over time, consider time series models like ARIMA or Prophet.

5.  **Evaluation:**
    *   **Metrics:** Use appropriate evaluation metrics for your chosen models (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression, accuracy/precision/recall for classification).
    *   **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Phase 2: Stock Prediction and Investment Recommendations

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    *   **Stock Data:** Obtain historical stock prices and other relevant data (e.g., volume, market capitalization) from reliable sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
    *   **Economic Indicators:** Gather economic data (e.g., GDP, inflation, interest rates) that may influence stock prices.

2.  **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Technical Indicators:** Calculate technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD) from stock prices.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze news articles and social media to gauge market sentiment.

3.  **Model Selection and Training:**
    *   **Time Series Models:** Use time series models like ARIMA, LSTM, or GRU to predict stock prices.
    *   **Machine Learning Models:** Use machine learning models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to predict stock price movements.

4.  **Investment Strategy:**
    *   **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your risk tolerance to determine the appropriate asset allocation.
    *   **Portfolio Optimization:** Use optimization techniques to create a portfolio that maximizes returns for a given level of risk.

## Phase 3: Integration and Refinement

1.  **Combine Predictions:** Integrate the predictions from your expense tracker model and your stock prediction model.
2.  **Refine Investment Recommendations:** Use the combined predictions to refine your investment recommendations, taking into account your spending habits and financial goals.
