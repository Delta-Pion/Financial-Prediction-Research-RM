## Qualities of a Good Model according to Ernie

- They are based on a sound econometric or rational basis, and not on random discovery of patterns.
- They have few parameters that need to be fitted to past data.
- They involve linear regression only, and not fitting to some esoteric nonlinear functions.
- They are conceptually simple.
- All optimizations must occur in a lookback moving window, involving no future unseen data. And the effect of this optimization must be continuously demonstrated using this future, unseen data.
