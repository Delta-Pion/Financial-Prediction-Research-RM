# Your Working Hours
Do you trade only part time? If so, you would probably want to con-
sider only strategies that hold overnight and not the intraday strate-
gies. Otherwise, you may have to fully automate your strategies (see
Chapter 5 on execution) so that they can run on autopilot most of
the time and alert you only when problems occur.

# Your Programming Skills
# Your Trading Capital
In general, I would not recommend
quantitative trading for an account with less than $50,000 capi-
tal. Let’s say the dividing line between a high- versus low-capital
account is $100,000

It affects how much you can spend on various infrastruc-
ture, data, and software. For example, if you have low trading capi-
tal, your online brokerage will not be likely to supply you with real-
time market data for too many stocks, so you can’t really have a
strategy that requires real-time market data over a large universe of
stocks. (You can, of course, subscribe to a third-party market data
vendor, but then the extra cost may not be justifiable if your trad-
ing capital is low.) 

Similarly, clean historical stock data with high
frequency costs more than historical daily stock data, so a high-
frequency stock-trading strategy may not be feasible with small cap-
ital expenditure

# How Does It Compare with a Benchmark and How consistent are its Returns
You must use [[Basic Terms#Information ratio or Sharpe ratio|Sharpe Ratio]] to asses how much bang for buck you are getting for the risk you take by comparing it with the market index

## [[Basic Terms#Drawdown|Drawdown]] is explained here

# How Will Transaction Costs Affect the Strategy?
- These transaction costs are not just due to commission fees charged by
	the broker. 

- There will also be the [[Basic Terms#Liquidity Costs|cost of liquidity]]—when you buy
	and sell securities at their market prices, you are paying the bid-ask
	spread.

- If you buy and sell securities using [[Basic Terms#Limit Orders| limit orders]], however,
	you avoid the liquidity costs but incur [[Basic Terms#Opportunity Costs|opportunity costs]] 

>[!faq] Info
>Transaction costs vary widely for different kinds of securities.
You can typically estimate it by taking half the average bid-ask
spread of a security and then adding the commission if your or-
der size is not much bigger than the average sizes of the best bid
and offer

### Example :

	If you are trading S&P 500 stocks, for example, the aver-
	age transaction cost (excluding commissions, which depend on your
	brokerage) would be about 5 basis points (that is, five-hundredths of
	a percent). Note that I count a round-trip transaction of a buy and
	then a sell as two transactions—hence, a round trip will cost 10 ba-
	sis points in this example

# Does the Data Suffer from Survivorship Bias?
A historical database of stock prices that does not include stocks
that have disappeared due to bankruptcies, delistings, mergers, or
acquisitions suffer from the so-called survivorship bias, because
only “survivors” of those often unpleasant events remain in the
database. (The same term can be applied to mutual fund or hedge
fund databases that do not include funds that went out of business.)

**Back testing a strategy using data with survivorship bias can be dangerous because it may inflate the historical performance of the strategy. This is especially true if the strategy has a “value” bent; that is, it tends to buy stocks that are cheap. Some stocks were cheap because the companies were going bankrupt shortly. So if your strategy includes only those cases when the stocks were very cheap but eventually survived (and maybe prospered) and neglects those cases where the stocks finally did get delisted, the back test performance will, of course, be much better than what a trader would actually have suffered at that time.**

So when you read about a “buy on the cheap” strategy that has
great performance, ask the author of that strategy whether it was
tested on survivorship bias–free (sometimes called “point-in-time”)
data. If not, be skeptical of its results.

# How Did the Performance of the Strategy Change over the Years?
This point may be hard to swallow for many statistically minded
readers. Many of them may think that the more data there is, the
more statistically robust the backtest should be. This is true only
when the financial time series is generated by a stationary process.
Unfortunately, financial time series is famously nonstationary.

# Does the Strategy Suffer from Data-Snooping Bias?
By having so many parameters, you are probably fitting the model to historical accidents in the past that will not repeat themselves in the future basically ***Overfitting***
