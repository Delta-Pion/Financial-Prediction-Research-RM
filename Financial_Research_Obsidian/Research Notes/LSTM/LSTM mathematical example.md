## LSTM Mathematical Example

Alright, let's walk through a simplified example of an LSTM cell calculation with some hypothetical values. I'll keep the vector dimensions small for clarity.

**Assumptions:**

- Input vector `x_t` is a 2-dimensional vector.
- Hidden state `h_t` is a 2-dimensional vector.
- Cell state `C_t` is a 2-dimensional vector.
- We'll use randomly chosen weights and biases for demonstration. In a real-world scenario, these would be learned during training.
- We'll use the NumPy library for calculations.

**Let's define the inputs:**
