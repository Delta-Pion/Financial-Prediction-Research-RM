# Basic Difference
## **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average): Modeling the Conditional MEAN**

- **What it stands for:** Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average.
    
- **What it models:** ARIMA models are primarily designed to model and forecast the **conditional mean** of a time series. In simpler terms, they focus on capturing the **level** of the series and how it changes over time due to its own past values and past errors.
    
- **Key Idea:** ARIMA models assume that the time series is **stationary** (or can be made stationary through differencing - the "Integrated" part). Stationarity means that the statistical properties of the series (like mean and variance) don't change over time. If a series isn't stationary, it might have trends or seasonal patterns that need to be removed before applying ARIMA.
    
- **Components:** ARIMA models are built from three core components:
    
    - **AR (Autoregressive):** Uses past values of the time series to predict the current value. It's like saying "today's value depends on yesterday's and the day before's values." Represented by the parameter 'p' (order of autoregression).
    - **I (Integrated):** Handles non-stationarity by differencing the time series. Differencing means subtracting the previous value from the current value. Represented by the parameter 'd' (degree of differencing).
    - **MA (Moving Average):** Uses past forecast errors (the difference between the actual past value and the ARIMA model's forecast of that past value) to predict the current value. It's like saying "today's value is also influenced by how wrong we were in our predictions yesterday and the day before." Represented by the parameter 'q' (order of moving average).
- **Output:** ARIMA models primarily produce forecasts of the **future values** of the time series itself (the conditional mean).
    
- **Typical Use Cases:**
    
    - Forecasting sales, demand, inventory levels.
    - Predicting economic indicators like inflation, GDP, unemployment.
    - Analyzing stock prices (though often less effective on their own for price forecasting due to volatility changes - see GARCH below).
    - Any situation where you want to predict the _level_ of a time series based on its past behavior.
- **Focus:** **Predicting the average level of the series over time.**
    

## **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity): Modeling the Conditional VARIANCE (Volatility)**

- **What it stands for:** Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. (A mouthful!)
    
- **What it models:** GARCH models are designed to model and forecast the **conditional variance** (or volatility) of a time series. In simpler words, they focus on capturing how the **spread or dispersion** of the data changes over time, especially the tendency for periods of high volatility to cluster together and periods of low volatility to cluster together (volatility clustering).
    
- **Key Idea:** GARCH models recognize that the variance of a time series is often **not constant** (heteroskedasticity). Instead, the variance can change over time and often depends on past variances and past squared errors. "Conditional" heteroskedasticity means the variance at a given time is conditional on past information.
    
- **Components:** GARCH models are also built from autoregressive and moving average components, but in this case, they are applied to the **variance** itself (or more accurately, to the squared errors from a mean model).
    
    - **ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity):** Base form. Uses past _squared_ errors to predict the current variance. It's like saying "today's volatility depends on how big the errors were in the past."
    - **GARCH (Generalized ARCH):** Extends ARCH by also using past _forecasted variances_ to predict the current variance. It's like saying "today's volatility also depends on what we predicted volatility would be in the past." Represented by parameters 'p' (order of GARCH - for lagged variances) and 'q' (order of ARCH - for lagged squared errors).
- **Output:** GARCH models primarily produce forecasts of the **future variance (volatility)** of the time series.
    
- **Typical Use Cases:**
    
    - **Financial Risk Management:** Modeling and forecasting volatility for risk assessment (e.g., Value at Risk - VaR), option pricing, portfolio management.
    - **Trading Strategies:** Identifying periods of high and low volatility to inform trading decisions.
    - **Volatility Forecasting in General:** Situations where understanding and predicting the _fluctuations_ of a time series is crucial.
- **Focus:** **Predicting the level of volatility (fluctuations, spread) of the series over time.**

**Analogy:**

Imagine tracking the temperature in your city every day.

- **ARIMA is like predicting the average temperature tomorrow based on past temperatures and patterns.** You are focusing on the typical temperature level.
- **GARCH is like predicting how much the temperature will fluctuate tomorrow compared to today.** You are focusing on whether the temperature will be stable or highly variable, irrespective of the average level. For example, you might predict higher temperature variability during the storm season.

**Can they be used together?**

***Yes, absolutely! Often, in financial time series especially, you can see patterns in both the mean and the variance.***

- ***You might first use an ARIMA model to model the conditional mean of a financial asset's returns. This ARIMA might capture some predictable average return behavior.***
- ***Then, you would apply a GARCH model to the residuals of the ARIMA model. The residuals are the "leftover" part of the time series after you've modeled the mean. If there's still structure in the residuals (specifically, volatility clustering), a GARCH model can capture and forecast that.***

**In essence:**

- **Think ARIMA when you want to understand and predict the _direction_ or _level_ of a time series.**
- **Think GARCH when you want to understand and predict the _risk_ or _spread_ (volatility) associated with a time series, especially when volatility changes over time.**

They are powerful tools in time series analysis, and understanding their differences is key to using them appropriately.

# ARIMA vs GARCH with mathematical backing

Let's break down the differences between ARIMA and GARCH with a real-life example and some simplified math.

## **Real-Life Example: Let's talk about Daily Stock Returns for a Tech Company (TechCo)**

Imagine you are analyzing the daily percentage changes in the stock price of TechCo. This is called the "daily return."

## **1. ARIMA - Modeling the Average Return (Mean)**

* **Scenario:** You observe that over the last few weeks, on average, TechCo's stock price has been slightly increasing each day.  You also notice that if the stock price went up yesterday, it's slightly more likely to go up again today (positive momentum).

* **What ARIMA does:** ARIMA would try to model this *average* daily return. It's looking for patterns in the *level* of the returns.

    * **Let's simplify to an AR(1) example (simplest form of ARIMA focusing on the 'AR' part):**

    * **Equation:**  `Return_today =  φ * Return_yesterday + μ + error_today`

        * `Return_today`: The percentage change in TechCo's stock price today.
        * `Return_yesterday`: The percentage change yesterday.
        * `φ` (phi):  A coefficient (say, 0.2).  This captures the "autoregressive" part. If `φ` is positive, it means if yesterday's return was positive, today's return is also likely to be slightly positive (momentum effect).
        * `μ` (mu):  The average daily return (say, 0.05%, or slightly positive average growth).
        * `error_today`:  A random "shock" or unexpected event that affects today's return. We assume these errors are (ideally) random and have a constant variance.

    * **In words:** ARIMA (in this simplified AR(1) form) is saying: "Today's stock return is partly predicted by yesterday's return (momentum), plus a constant average return, plus some random noise."

* **ARIMA Output:** After fitting an ARIMA model to historical returns data, you could get forecasts for the *future average daily returns* of TechCo's stock. You'd be predicting whether the stock price is likely to go up on average tomorrow, the day after, etc.

* **ARIMA Limitations in this Stock Example (Key Point for GARCH):**  ARIMA *assumes* that the **variance of the `error_today` term is constant over time**. But in the stock market, this is often NOT true! You've probably noticed that sometimes the stock market is calm and returns are pretty stable, and other times it's very volatile with big swings in price - the *volatility changes over time*.  ARIMA doesn't directly model this changing volatility.

## **2. GARCH - Modeling the Volatility (Variance) of Returns**

* **Scenario:** You notice that for TechCo (and the market in general), there are periods of high volatility and periods of low volatility.  When there's big news (like interest rate hikes or a company earnings announcement), the daily returns become much more unpredictable and move around a lot more (high volatility).  After a while, things calm down and the returns become more stable (low volatility).  This is **volatility clustering** – periods of high volatility tend to be followed by more high volatility, and periods of low volatility by low volatility.

* **What GARCH does:** GARCH is designed specifically to model this *changing volatility* (conditional variance). It looks at how the *spread* or *dispersion* of the returns is changing over time.

    * **Let's simplify to a GARCH(1,1) example (common and relatively simple form):**

    * **First, we need to consider the errors from our mean model (like ARIMA, or even a simpler mean model). Let's say we've used ARIMA to model the *mean* return, and we get the 'error' terms (residuals) – let's call them `ε_t` (epsilon at time t).**  Think of `ε_t` as the *unexpected* part of the return that ARIMA couldn't predict.

    * **GARCH Equation for the Conditional Variance (Volatility):**

        * `σ²_today = α₀ + α₁ * ε²_yesterday + β₁ * σ²_yesterday`

            * `σ²_today`:  The *conditional variance* of today's return (our measure of volatility *for today*).  It's "conditional" because it's based on past information.
            * `α₀` (alpha-zero): A constant, representing a baseline level of variance.
            * `α₁` (alpha-one):  A coefficient (say, 0.1).  This is the ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) component.  `ε²_yesterday` is yesterday's *squared* error (from our mean model, like ARIMA). If yesterday had a big unexpected return (either positive or negative – so squared error is big), then today's variance is likely to be higher. This captures the idea that big shocks lead to increased volatility.
            * `β₁` (beta-one): A coefficient (say, 0.8). This is the GARCH (Generalized ARCH) component. `σ²_yesterday` is yesterday's *predicted variance* (volatility). If yesterday was already a volatile day, today is also likely to be volatile. This captures the persistence of volatility.

    * **In words:** GARCH(1,1) is saying: "<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Today's volatility (variance) is determined by a baseline level, plus how big the unexpected returns were yesterday (squared error), plus how volatile yesterday itself was.</mark>"

* **GARCH Output:** After fitting a GARCH model (typically *after* having a model for the mean return, like ARIMA), you get forecasts for the *future volatility* (conditional variance) of TechCo's stock returns. You'd predict whether volatility is likely to be high or low tomorrow, the day after, etc.

* **GARCH Benefit for Stock Example:** GARCH is much more realistic for financial data because it explicitly models the changing volatility. This is crucial for risk management, option pricing, and many other financial applications where understanding and predicting volatility is key.

**Key Differences Summarized with Math and Example:**

| Feature             | ARIMA (simplified to AR(1) Example)               | GARCH (simplified to GARCH(1,1) Example)             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **What it models**   | **Conditional Mean** (average return level)     | **Conditional Variance** (volatility of returns)        |
| **Equation (Simplified)** | `Return_today =  φ * Return_yesterday + μ + error_today` | `σ²_today = α₀ + α₁ * ε²_yesterday + β₁ * σ²_yesterday` |
| **Focus**            | Predicting the direction/level of returns        | Predicting the spread/fluctuations/volatility of returns  |
| **Assumptions about Error** | Errors (`error_today`) have *constant* variance.    | Variance of errors (*modeled*) is *not constant* (heteroskedasticity). |
| **Input Data**        | Time series itself (e.g., daily returns)          | Primarily the *squared errors* (residuals) from a mean model (like ARIMA). Though conceptually, used on the returns' volatility. |
| **Output**           | Forecasted future average returns                 | Forecasted future volatility (conditional variance)       |
| **Real-Life Focus (Stock Example)** | Predicting if stock price will go up/down on average | Predicting if stock price fluctuations will be large or small (risk) |

**How they work together (Often Combined in Finance):**

In practice, especially in finance, you often use them together:

1. **First, build an ARIMA (or simpler mean model) to model the *average* return.** You try to capture any predictable patterns in the mean return itself.

2. **Then, apply a GARCH model to the *residuals* (errors) from the ARIMA model.**  The residuals represent the unpredictable part of the return. GARCH then models the *volatility* of these unpredictable residuals.

**Analogy - Weather & Storms:**

* **ARIMA (Weather forecast for temperature):** Like predicting the *average temperature* tomorrow based on past temperatures and seasonal patterns. Focus on the level. "Tomorrow will be, on average, 25 degrees Celsius."

* **GARCH (Storm/Rain intensity forecast):** Like predicting the *intensity of storms* or *variability of rainfall* for tomorrow. Focus on volatility/spread. "Tomorrow will be a day of *high* weather variability - expect potentially strong storms or very sunny periods, unlike yesterday which was consistently cloudy."

In the stock market, you might want to know both:

* "On average, is this stock likely to go up or down tomorrow?" (ARIMA part)
* "How risky is this stock tomorrow? Will the price swings be large or small regardless of the direction?" (GARCH part)

ARIMA and GARCH are powerful tools when used appropriately for the type of time series pattern you are trying to capture. They are often used in tandem, especially in fields like finance, where both the average value and the volatility are important.
