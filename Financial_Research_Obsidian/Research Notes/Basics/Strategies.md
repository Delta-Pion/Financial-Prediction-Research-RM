# Long-Short Strategy:

 • Long Position: 
	 Buying an asset with the expectation that its price will increase. You profit if the price goes up.
 • Short Position: 
	 Borrowing an asset and selling it with the expectation that its price will decrease. You profit if the price goes down (because you can buy it back at a  
	   lower price to return it to the lender).
 • Long-Short Strategy: 
	 A strategy that involves simultaneously taking long positions in some assets and short positions in other assets. The goal is to profit from the     
	   relative performance of the assets, rather than just relying on the overall market direction.

# Dollar-Neutral Strategy:

 • Dollar-Neutral: This means that the total dollar value of the long positions is approximately equal to the total dollar value of the short positions. For example, if you 
   have $1 million in long positions, you would also have approximately $1 million in short positions.
 • Purpose of Dollar-Neutrality: The main purpose of being dollar-neutral is to reduce or eliminate the portfolio's exposure to overall market movements (market risk or     
   beta). If the market goes up, the long positions should gain value, but the short positions should lose value (and vice versa). By being dollar-neutral, these gains and  
   losses should offset each other to some extent.

# Long-Short Dollar-Neutral Strategy:

 • Combining the two concepts, a long-short dollar-neutral strategy aims to profit from the difference in performance between the long and short positions, while minimizing 
   the impact of overall market fluctuations. The strategy is betting that the selected long positions will outperform the selected short positions, regardless of whether   
   the market as a whole goes up, down, or sideways.
