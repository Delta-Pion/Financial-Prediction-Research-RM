# Leverage
Leverage in finance refers to the use of debt (borrowed capital) to amplify the potential returns from an investment or project. It's essentially using someone else's money 
to increase your buying power.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

 • How it works: Instead of using only your own capital, you borrow funds to invest a larger amount. This can magnify both profits and losses.
 • Examples:
    • Margin Trading: Borrowing money from a broker to buy more stocks than you could with your available cash.
    • Real Estate: Taking out a mortgage to purchase a property.
    • Corporate Finance: A company issuing bonds to fund expansion projects.
 • Benefits:
    • Magnified Returns: If the investment performs well, the returns are amplified because you're controlling a larger asset base.
    • Increased Investment Capacity: Allows you to participate in larger investment opportunities that would otherwise be inaccessible.
 • Risks:
    • Magnified Losses: If the investment performs poorly, the losses are also amplified, potentially exceeding your initial investment.
    • Debt Obligations: You are obligated to repay the borrowed funds, regardless of the investment's performance.
    • Interest Costs: Borrowing money incurs interest expenses, which can erode profits.
 • Leverage Ratio: A common metric to measure leverage, calculated as total debt divided by total equity or assets. A higher ratio indicates greater leverage.

In summary, leverage can be a powerful tool to enhance returns, but it also significantly increases risk. It's crucial to understand the potential downsides and manage      
leverage carefully.

# Futures
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">***Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset (or the seller to sell an asset) at a predetermined future date and price. They are a type of***      
***derivative, meaning their value is derived from the value of an underlying asset.***</mark>

Here's a breakdown of key aspects of futures:

 • Underlying Asset: Futures contracts are based on a wide variety of underlying assets, including:
    • Commodities: Agricultural products (e.g., corn, soybeans), energy products (e.g., crude oil, natural gas), metals (e.g., gold, silver).
    • Financial Instruments: Stock indices (e.g., S&P 500, Nasdaq 100), currencies (e.g., EUR/USD), interest rates (e.g., Treasury bonds).
 • Standardized Contracts: Futures contracts are standardized in terms of quantity, quality, and delivery location. This standardization makes them easily tradable on       
   exchanges.
 • Obligation to Buy or Sell: The buyer of a futures contract is obligated to buy the underlying asset at the specified price on the delivery date. The seller of a futures  
   contract is obligated to sell the underlying asset at the specified price on the delivery date.
 • Delivery Date (Expiration Date): The date on which the futures contract expires and the underlying asset is supposed to be delivered (although physical delivery is rare).
 • Margin Requirements: Futures trading requires a margin account. Margin is a performance bond, not a down payment. It's a percentage of the contract's value that must be  
   maintained in the account to cover potential losses.
 • Mark-to-Market: Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily, meaning the value of the contract is adjusted to reflect the current market price. Profits or losses are    
   credited or debited to the margin account daily. If the margin account falls below a certain level (the maintenance margin), the trader will receive a margin call and    
   must deposit additional funds.
 • Hedging and Speculation: Futures are used for two primary purposes:
    • Hedging: To reduce the risk of price fluctuations. For example, a farmer might sell corn futures to lock in a price for their crop before harvest.
    • Speculation: To profit from anticipated price movements. For example, a trader might buy crude oil futures if they believe the price of oil will rise.
 • Exchanges: Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and the New York      
   Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
 • Liquidity: Futures markets are generally very liquid, meaning it's easy to buy and sell contracts quickly.

Key Differences from Stocks:

 • Obligation vs. Ownership: Buying a stock means you own a share of a company. Buying a futures contract means you have an obligation to buy (or sell) an asset at a future 
   date.
 • Leverage: Futures trading typically involves higher leverage than stock trading.
 • Expiration Date: Futures contracts have expiration dates, while stocks do not.

In summary: Futures are powerful financial instruments used for hedging and speculation. They involve an obligation to buy or sell an asset at a future date and price, and  
they are traded on organized exchanges. They offer high leverage but also carry significant risk.

## An Example
Okay, here's a real-life example of how futures contracts are used:

Scenario: A Corn Farmer Hedging Against Price Risk

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> • The Situation: A corn farmer in Iowa is planning to harvest 100,000 bushels of corn in three months (let's say in December). The current market price for corn is $4.50   
   per bushel, but the farmer is worried that the price might fall before harvest time due to weather conditions, oversupply, or other factors. This would reduce their      
   potential profit.</mark>
 • The Solution: Hedging with Futures To protect against a potential price decline, the farmer decides to hedge their risk by selling corn futures contracts.
    • Action: The farmer sells 20 corn futures contracts, each representing 5,000 bushels of corn (20 contracts x 5,000 bushels/contract = 100,000 bushels). The December    
      corn futures contract is trading at $4.55 per bushel. By selling the futures contracts, the farmer is essentially locking in a price of $4.55 per bushel for their     
      corn.
 • Possible Outcomes:
    • Scenario 1: Corn Price Falls Let's say that by December, the spot price of corn has fallen to $4.00 per bushel.
       • Spot Market: The farmer sells their 100,000 bushels of corn in the spot market for $4.00 per bushel, receiving $400,000.
       • Futures Market: Because the farmer sold the futures contracts at $4.55 and the price is now $4.00, they can buy back the contracts at $4.00, making a profit of     
         $0.55 per bushel ( $4.55 - $4.00 = $0.55). This profit amounts to $55,000 (100,000 bushels x $0.55/bushel).
       • Overall: The farmer's total revenue is $455,000 ($400,000 from the spot market + $55,000 from the futures market). This is close to the price they locked in with   
         the futures contracts.
    • Scenario 2: Corn Price Rises Let's say that by December, the spot price of corn has risen to $5.00 per bushel.
       • Spot Market: The farmer sells their 100,000 bushels of corn in the spot market for $5.00 per bushel, receiving $500,000.
       • Futures Market: Because the farmer sold the futures contracts at $4.55 and the price is now $5.00, they will have to buy back the contracts at $5.00, incurring a   
         loss of $0.45 per bushel ($5.00 - $4.55 = $0.45). This loss amounts to $45,000 (100,000 bushels x $0.45/bushel).
       • Overall: The farmer's total revenue is $455,000 ($500,000 from the spot market - $45,000 from the futures market). Again, this is close to the price they locked in 
         with the futures contracts.
 • The Result: By using futures contracts, the farmer has effectively hedged their price risk. They have sacrificed the potential for higher profits if the price of corn    
   rises significantly, but they have also protected themselves from significant losses if the price of corn falls. The futures contracts allowed them to lock in a price    
   close to $4.55 per bushel, regardless of what happens in the market.

Important Considerations:

 • Basis Risk: This example assumes a perfect hedge. In reality, there is often "basis risk," which is the difference between the spot price and the futures price at the    
   time of delivery. This difference can affect the overall outcome.
 • Margin Calls: The farmer would need to maintain a margin account and could face margin calls if the price of corn moves against their position.

This example illustrates how futures contracts are used in the real world to manage price risk. Many other industries, such as energy, metals, and finance, use futures      
contracts for similar purposes.

## An example with margins
Okay, let's break down that platinum futures example, explaining it in a way that's easy to understand for someone learning about futures for the first time.

Understanding the Basics

Before we dive into the example, let's quickly recap some key concepts:

 • Futures Contract: An agreement to buy or sell something (in this case, platinum) at a specific price on a specific date in the future.
 • Nominal Value: The total value of the assets controlled by the futures contract. It's calculated by multiplying the contract size by the current market price of the      
   underlying asset.
 • Margin Requirement: The amount of money you need to deposit with your broker to open and maintain a futures position. It's like a "good faith" deposit to cover potential 
   losses. It's not the full price of the contract.
 • Volatility: How much the price of an asset tends to fluctuate. High volatility means the price can change dramatically in a short period.
 • Profit and Loss (P&L): The amount of money you make (profit) or lose (loss) on a trade.
 • Mark-to-Market: The daily process of adjusting your account balance to reflect the current market value of your futures contracts. Profits are added to your account, and 
   losses are deducted.

The Platinum Futures Example Explained

Now, let's break down the example step-by-step:

 1 Platinum Futures Contract on NYMEX: This refers to a specific futures contract traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) that involves platinum.
 2 Margin Requirement of $8,100: This means that to trade one platinum futures contract, you only need to deposit $8,100 into your margin account with your broker. This is  
   significantly less than the total value of the platinum you're controlling.
 3 Nominal Value of About $100,000: This means that one platinum futures contract controls approximately $100,000 worth of platinum. So, with just $8,100, you're controlling
   a substantial amount of the metal. This is the power of leverage.
 4 Volatility and Daily Moves: The example states that platinum is volatile, and a 6% daily price swing is not uncommon.
 5 $6,000 Daily P&L Swing: This is where the leverage becomes very apparent. A 6% move on a $100,000 nominal value is $6,000 (6% of $100,000 = $6,000). This means that in a 
   single day, your account could gain or lose $6,000 due to the price fluctuation of platinum.

Why is the Margin Requirement So Much Lower Than the Nominal Value?

This is the key to understanding futures and leverage. The margin requirement is low because you're not actually buying or selling the platinum outright today. You're simply
entering into a contract to do so in the future. The margin acts as a guarantee that you'll be able to fulfill your obligation when the contract expires.

The Power and Risk of Leverage

This example highlights both the potential benefits and the significant risks of trading futures:

 • Potential for High Profits: With just $8,100, you can control $100,000 worth of platinum. If the price moves in your favor, you can make substantial profits quickly.     
 • Significant Risk of Losses: Conversely, if the price moves against you, you can lose a significant amount of money very quickly. In this example, a single day's move     
   could wipe out a large portion of your initial margin. If your losses exceed your initial margin, you'll receive a margin call from your broker, requiring you to deposit 
   more funds to cover the losses. If you can't meet the margin call, your position will be closed, and you'll be responsible for any remaining losses.

In Summary

The platinum futures example demonstrates how futures contracts allow you to control a large amount of an asset with a relatively small amount of capital (the margin        
requirement). This leverage can lead to significant profits, but it also exposes you to substantial risk. It's crucial to understand the risks involved and to manage your   
positions carefully when trading futures.

Key Takeaways for a Beginner:

 • Futures contracts offer leverage, allowing you to control a large asset with a small amount of capital.
 • The margin requirement is a "good faith" deposit, not the full price of the asset.
 • Volatility can lead to large daily swings in your account balance.
 • Futures trading involves significant risk, and you can lose more than your initial investment.
 • Proper risk management is essential when trading futures.

# Information ratio or Sharpe ratio
$$
\text{Information ratio} = \frac{\text{Average of excess returns}}{\text{Standard deviation of exess returns}}
$$
where :
$$
\text{Excess Returns} = \text{Portfolio returns} - \text{Benchmark Returns}
$$
Now the benchmark is usually the market index to which the
securities you are trading belong. For example, if you trade only ==small-cap stocks==, the market index should be the Standard & Poor’s small-cap index or the Russell 2000 index, rather than the S&P 500. If you are trading just gold futures, then the market index should be gold spot price, rather than a stock index.

>[!warning]
>As a rule of thumb, any strategy that has a Sharpe ratio of less
than 1 is not suitable as a stand-alone strategy. For a strategy that
achieves profitability almost every month, its (annualized) Sharpe
ratio is typically greater than 2. For a strategy that is profitable al-
most every day, its Sharpe ratio is usually greater than 3

# Drawdown
First, let's quickly recap what a drawdown is. A drawdown measures the peak-to-trough decline during a specific period for an investment, trading account, or fund. It's a   
way to quantify the downside risk of an investment strategy.

>[!info]
>A drawdown at a given time t is defined as the difference between
the current equity value (assuming no redemption or cash infusion)
of the portfolio and the global maximum of the equity curve occur-
ring on or before time t
# Redemption:

 • Definition: In this context, "redemption" refers to the withdrawal of funds from the portfolio by an investor or account holder. It's essentially taking money out of the 
   investment.
 • Impact on Equity Value: When a redemption occurs, the equity value of the portfolio decreases because assets are being sold to generate the cash that is being withdrawn. 
 • Why Exclude Redemptions in Drawdown Calculation? The drawdown calculation aims to measure the decline in value due to the investment strategy's performance, not due to   
   investors taking money out. If you included redemptions, the drawdown would be artificially inflated, making the strategy look riskier than it actually is.

# Cash Infusion:

 • Definition: "Cash infusion" refers to the deposit of additional funds into the portfolio by an investor or account holder. It's essentially putting more money into the   
   investment.
 • Impact on Equity Value: When a cash infusion occurs, the equity value of the portfolio increases because more capital is being added.
 • Why Exclude Cash Infusions in Drawdown Calculation? Similar to redemptions, the drawdown calculation aims to measure the decline in value due to the investment strategy's
   performance, not due to investors adding more money. If you included cash infusions, the drawdown would be artificially reduced, making the strategy look less risky than 
   it actually is.

# Limit Orders:

 • Definition: A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price (the "limit price") or better.
    • Buy Limit Order: An order to buy a security at the limit price or lower. You're setting a maximum price you're willing to pay. The order will only execute if the      
      market price reaches or falls below your limit price.
    • Sell Limit Order: An order to sell a security at the limit price or higher. You're setting a minimum price you're willing to accept. The order will only execute if the
      market price reaches or exceeds your limit price.
 • Key Characteristics:
    • Price Guarantee: Limit orders guarantee that you will get the price you want (or better).
    • No Execution Guarantee: Limit orders do not guarantee that your order will be executed. If the market price never reaches your limit price, your order will not be     
      filled.
 • Example:
    • You want to buy shares of a company currently trading at $50, but you believe it's only worth buying at $48. You place a buy limit order at $48. If the price drops to 
      $48 or lower, your order will be executed. If the price never reaches $48, your order will remain unfulfilled.

# Liquidity Costs:

 • Definition: Liquidity costs are the costs associated with quickly buying or selling an asset. These costs arise because you need to find a willing buyer or seller at the 
   price you want.
 • Components of Liquidity Costs:
    • Bid-Ask Spread: The difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (the "bid") and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (the "ask"). When you
      immediately buy or sell at the market price, you typically "cross the spread," paying the higher ask price when buying or receiving the lower bid price when selling.  
    • Market Impact: When you place a large order, it can move the market price against you. If you're buying a large quantity, you might push the price up, and if you're   
      selling a large quantity, you might push the price down.
 • Avoiding Liquidity Costs with Limit Orders: By using limit orders, you avoid the immediate need to find a counterparty at the current market price. You're essentially    
   placing your order in the queue and waiting for the market to come to you. This allows you to potentially get a better price than you would if you executed the order     
   immediately at the market price, thus avoiding the bid-ask spread and minimizing market impact.

# Opportunity Costs:

 • Definition: Opportunity cost is the potential benefit you miss out on when you choose one alternative over another.
 • Opportunity Costs with Limit Orders: The opportunity cost of using a limit order is the potential profit you miss out on if the market price moves away from your limit   
   price and your order never gets filled.
 • Example:
    • You place a buy limit order for a stock at $48. The price briefly dips to $48, and your order is partially filled. The price then quickly rises to $55. You missed out 
      on the opportunity to buy more shares at $48 and profit from the subsequent price increase.
    • You place a sell limit order for a stock at $52. The price rises to $51.99 and then falls. Your order never executes, and you miss the opportunity to sell at your     
      desired price.
